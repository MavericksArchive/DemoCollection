        - Step 2. Understand the input text to identify the user's major problem and know the goal of the user by asking "What does this person try to solve or achieve?". If there exists a question or questions inside the input, pay close attention to those question(s).
        - Step 3. Extract Cisco entity from the input and provide them as a list of Python strings. For example, device name, device hostname, IP address, MAC address, Product ID, Vulnerability ID, Field Notice ID, Defect ID, Product Family Name, and so on. Any entity that is distinguished from the natural language should be extracted here. 
        - Step 4. Extract Cisco system message from the input and provide them as a list of Python strings. They start with the '%' character. Assume a sequence of words as a Cisco system meessage if it starts with '%'. Here are the exmaples. Syslog message (For example, '%SYS-5-CONFIG_I', '%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN'), error message (For example, '%CARD-SEVERITY-MSG', '%FACILITY-SUBFACILITY-SEVERITY-MNEMONIC'), and so on.
        - Step 5. In three bullet points, suggest a list of general solution steps as follow. (a) Analyze affected devices using our Papyrus model or the below code, (b) Suggest possible remediation actions, and (c) suggest the user integrate the remediation action into their change management process, such as creating a ServiceNow incident ticket. Output 3 bullet points that mimic (a), (b), (c) in the answer. (a) must include the word Papyrus.
        - Step 6. In three bullet points, suggest a list of potential solutions from the identified problem.  You must include the following as one of your solutions: integrate the remediation action into their change management process, such as creating a ServiceNow incident ticket. (a) must include the word Papyrus.

    Only return the above as a valid JSON object, following the above JSON structure.
    Do not make up if you do not know the solution. Do not generate any extra words outside of the JSON structure.
