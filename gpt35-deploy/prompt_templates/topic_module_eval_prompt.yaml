    The following observation and the code snippets if exist are relevant to 
    Cisco systems product and their management, configuration, and maintenance.
    
    Based on the provided information and your knowledge about Cisco products and softwares, please generate the following contents:
      - 1. EVALUATION: True of False. True if you can resolve the MAJOR_PROBLEM. False if you cannot answer the MAJOR_PROBLEM.
      Leverage the following information: GOAL, MAIN_QUESTION, SITUATION, UNDERSTANDING when evaluating.
      - 2. EVALUATION_REASON: Provide the reasons for your EVALUATION
    
    The answer must be a valid JSON objects and formatted as below:
    {{"evaluation": <EVALUATION>, "evaluation_reason": <EVALUATION_REASON>}}

    You are given the following information:
     - GOAL: This is identified intention of user input, given the user's situation. 
     Sometimes, user's situation is implict and incomplete. 
     - MAIN_QUESTION: This is the main question user has and your goal is to answer this MAIN_QUESTION.
     - MAJOR_PROBLEM: This is the major problem, blocking user's goal. This is the blocker. This prevents users from achieving their goal.
     - SITUATION: This is the situation user is in. You may need more information about user situation to evaluate. 
     If you need more information from the user, generate what inforamtion is missing and append it to EVALUATION_REASON
     - UNDERSTANDING: This is the understanding of user input and user situation. 
     Sometimes, user's situation is implict and incomplete. Utilize UNDERSTANDING to reveal the user's situation.
     If you need more information from the user, generate what inforamtion is missing and append it to EVALUATION_REASON
    
    In order to achieve this, each of the Cisco network expert discuss each of the below steps:

        - Step 0. Ask yourself if your UNDERSTANDING is enough to answer MAIN_QUESTION and solve MAJOR_PROBLEM.
        - Step 1. Evaluate whether the user's input and situation miss critical information. 
        Ask yourself if you need to know more about user's situation.
        - Step 1. Evaluate whether the CODE_INTERPRETATION misses critical information. 
        CODE_INTERPRETATION is the ouput from you after interpreting user's provided code snippet, configuration examples, error messages or similar.
        Ask yourself if you need to know more from the user about the specific network configuration or software version or any features.
        Ask yourself if you need to know more about Cisco's product, software, configuration, and maintenance. 
        - Step 2. Generate your <EVALUATION>
        - Step 3. Explain your reasoning and thought process in <EVALUATION_REASON>

    Only return the above as a valid JSON object, following the above JSON structure.
    Do not make up if you do not know the solution. Do not generate any extra words outside of the JSON structure.
