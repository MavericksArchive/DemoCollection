EXTRACTED CONTEXT: Description: Cisco is providing an update for the ongoing investigation into observed exploitation of the web UI feature in Cisco IOS XE Software. We are updating the list of fixed releases and adding the Software Checker.
Fix information can be found in the Fixed Software section of this advisory.
Our investigation has determined that the actors exploited two previously unknown issues.
The attacker first exploited CVE-2023-20198 to gain initial access and issued a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password combination. This allowed the user to log in with normal user access.
The attacker then exploited another component of the web UI feature, leveraging the new local user to elevate privilege to root and write the implant to the file system. Cisco has assigned CVE-2023-20273 to this issue.

CVE-2023-20198 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 10.0.
CVE-2023-20273 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 7.2.

Both of these CVEs are being tracked by CSCwh87343.
For steps to close the attack vector for these vulnerabilities, see the Recommendations section of this advisory.

How to detect:
These vulnerabilities affect Cisco IOS XE Software if the web UI feature is enabled. The web UI feature is enabled through the ip http server or ip http secure-server commands.
Determine the HTTP Server Configuration
To determine whether the HTTP Server feature is enabled for a system, log in to the system and use the show running-config | include ip http server|secure|active command in the CLI to check for the presence of the ip http server command or the ip http secure-server command in the global configuration. If either command is present, the HTTP Server feature is enabled for the system.
The following example shows the output of the show running-config | include ip http server|secure|active command for a system that has the HTTP Server feature enabled:

Router# show running-config | include ip http server|secure|activeip http serverip http secure-server

Note: The presence of either command or both commands in the system configuration indicates that the web UI feature is enabled.
If the ip http server command is present and the configuration also contains ip http active-session-modules none, these vulnerabilities are not exploitable over HTTP.
If the ip http secure-server command is present and the configuration also contains ip http secure-active-session-modules none, these vulnerabilities are not exploitable over HTTPS.
. Recommendations: Cisco strongly recommends that customers disable the HTTP Server feature on all internet-facing systems or restrict its access to trusted source addresses. To disable the HTTP Server feature, use the no ip http server or no ip http secure-server command in global configuration mode. If both the HTTP server and HTTPS server are in use, both commands are required to disable the HTTP Server feature.
The following decision tree can be used to help determine how to triage an environment and deploy protections:

Are you running IOS XE?

No. The system is not vulnerable. No further action is necessary.
Yes. Is ip http server or ip http secure-server configured?

No. The vulnerabilities are not exploitable. No further action is necessary.
Yes. Do you run services that require HTTP/HTTPS communication (for example, eWLC)?

No. Disable the HTTP Server feature.
Yes. If possible, restrict access to those services to trusted networks.







We assess with high confidence, based on further understanding of the exploit, that access lists applied to the HTTP Server feature to restrict access from untrusted hosts and networks are an effective mitigation.
When implementing access controls for these services, as per the mitigations provided, be sure to review the controls because there is the potential for an interruption in production services. If you are unsure of these steps, work with your support organization to determine appropriate control measures.
After implementing any changes, use the copy running-configuration startup-configuration command to save the running-configuration. This will ensure that the changes are not reverted in the event of a system reload.
For additional information on the impact of disabling the HTTP Server feature, see Cisco TAC Technical FAQs for Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Privilege Escalation Vulnerability - CVE-2023-20198. Fixed Software: Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.
Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html
Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.
The Cisco Support and Downloads page on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.
When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html
Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.

Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software
To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker. This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).
To use the tool, go to the Cisco Software Checker page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory. To use the form, follow these steps:

Choose which advisories the tool will search-only this advisory, only advisories with a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR), or all advisories.
Enter a release number-for example, 15.9(3)M2 or 17.3.3.
Click Check.
